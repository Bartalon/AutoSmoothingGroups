Thank you for downloading the AutoSmoothingGroups script for Maya!


///////////  Installation

1.  	Exit Maya

2.  	Navigate to your local "My Documents" Maya directory, which should look something like:   C:\Users\Dennis\Documents\maya\2018\prefs
			The number in this directory path will reflect which version of Maya you are using.  It may be 2013-x64, 2016.5, 2017LT, etc.

3.  	Paste dp_autoSmoothingGroups.mel into the   \maya\2018\prefs\scripts   directory.
			Note that the scripts directory in this step refers to the one inside the PREFS folder.  There is another scripts directory under
			the folder labeled with your version of Maya (maya\2018\scripts): if you install here, the script will not work properly.

5.  	Open Maya

6.	 	In the Script Editor or MEL command line, copy and paste the following line below:

			source dp_autoSmoothingGroups.mel;

7.		Save the command above as a shelf button to run at your convenience!
